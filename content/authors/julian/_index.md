Julian joined the HEX Lab as postdoctoral researcher in September 2022. He holds a bachelor’s and master’s degree in medical engineering from [FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg](https://www.medical-engineering.study.fau.eu/). In his Ph.D. project at [TU Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de/ing/informatik/ai/mci/die-professur) and [TH Nürnberg](https://www.th-nuernberg.de/einrichtungen-gesamt/wissenschaftliche-und-forschungskooperationen/nuremberg-campus-of-technology/ambient-intelligence/), he has been researching human-computer interaction, especially accessibility, i.e., Virtual Reality (VR), to support blind and visually impaired people. He has also been author in projects and publications in [transportation and urban planning](https://www.th-nuernberg.de/einrichtungen-gesamt/wissenschaftliche-und-forschungskooperationen/nuremberg-campus-of-technology/intelligente-verkehrsplanung/) and [communication of sustainability](https://www.th-nuernberg.de/einrichtungen-gesamt/wissenschaftliche-und-forschungskooperationen/nuremberg-campus-of-technology/technik-wirtschaft-gesellschaft/) in terms of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR). His research at TUM focuses on an Artificial intelligence (AI) based guidance systems to support the operating room team through multimodal interaction with AR glasses.
