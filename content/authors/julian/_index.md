I studied medical engineering (Bachelor and Master) at FAU Erlangen and finished my PhD in computer science at TU Dresden and TH Nürnberg. I've been authoring research on AR/VR for accessibility, urban transportation, sustainability, and medical use cases. My research interests include HCI and connections to AI, especially VR/AR, and interdisciplinary applications.
