Dimash is an MSc student at the University of Calgary and a member of the iLab group. With the support of a Mitacs Globalink Research Award, his research explores haptics in robotics, XR, and sensory substitution. His current work focuses on developing tongue-based haptic feedback interfaces to improve control and precision in robot-assisted surgeries. At HEX Lab, Dimash continues to build on his interest in robotics and haptics, working to bring intuitive, responsive feedback systems into surgical settings.
