Luisa is a PhD candidate at the Professorship for Machine Intelligence in Orthopedics / Human-Centered Computing and Extended Reality Lab of TU Munich. During her PhD, she focuses on infection prediction and decision support in acute care and investigates how new AI-driven human-computer interaction interfaces can be embedded into clinical routines. She received her bachelor's and master's degrees in medical engineering from FAU Erlangen-N端rnberg.

Luisa is supported by a scholarship from Siemens Healthineers and the Digital Health Innovation Platform (d.hip). Thank you!
