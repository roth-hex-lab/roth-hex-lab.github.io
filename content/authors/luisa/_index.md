Luisa is a Doctoral candidate at the Professorship for Machine Intelligence in Orthopedics / Human-Centered Computing and Extended Reality Lab of TU Munich. During her PhD, she focuses on infection prediction and decision support in acute care and investigates how new AI-driven human-computer interaction interfaces can be embedded into clinical routines. She received her bachelor's and master's degrees in medical engineering from FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg.

Luisa was supported by a scholarship from Siemens Healthineers and the Digital Health Innovation Platform (d.hip). From 2021-2023. Thank you!
