	abstract = {Specialized robotic and surgical tools are increasing the complexity of operating rooms (ORs), requiring elaborate preparation especially when techniques or devices are to be used for the first time. Spatial planning can improve efficiency and identify procedural obstacles ahead of time, but real ORs offer little availability to optimize space utilization. Methods for creating reconstructions of physical setups, i.e., digital twins, are needed to enable immersive spatial planning of such complex environments in virtual reality.},
