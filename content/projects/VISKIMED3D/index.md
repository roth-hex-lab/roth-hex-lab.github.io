VISKIMED3D (German: (Visuell-Sprachliche KI-Modelle für Inklusive Medizinische Anwendungen in 3D) is a two-year project funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy.

The project aims to develop a digital system that can capture human movements in detail and provide multimodal intelligent feedback in real time. The system will be available for use in the healthcare sector. In the field of digital physiotherapy, the system will be used on commercially available devices such as smartphones in private settings. The user is filmed while performing the exercises and the system provides immediate feedback. It assesses whether the exercises are being performed correctly or incorrectly and offers individual suggestions for improvement.

**IAT**\
\
The Institute of Work and Technology (IAT) is a central scientific institution of the Westphalian University of Applied Sciences (WH) in cooperation with the Ruhr University Bochum. The focus “Health Economy & Quality of Life” combines research, development and testing of innovative design solutions in the health economy with the aim of creating a demand-oriented supply design, identifying and overcoming obstacles to innovation and demonstrating sustainable design options. In order to achieve these goals, the project is being conducted on several levels, from which three thematic areas can be derived: 1 Health care – health care on a national and international level in the outpatient and inpatient sectors; 2 Individual health – health development trajectories, health behavior, personal responsibility for health and health competence; 3 Living conditions – demographic change, products and services for the elderly, but also forms of living and forms of life-world-oriented (self-)organization.
\
The three thematic areas are not to be understood as separate research units; rather, there are a number of interfaces that are reflected in the activities of the research focus. These interfaces are demographic change digitalization, social inequality and economic efficiency. In the area of digital health and assistive technologies, the IAT can draw on a broad range of experience from projects dealing with ELSI issues in.

**Dr. Peter Enste**\
\
Dr. Peter Enste has been director of the research focus Health Economy & Quality of Life (G&L) at the Institute for Work and Technology (IAT) since 2020. He studied social sciences at the Ruhr University Bochum and completed his doctorate on the topic of “Health-related personal responsibility in the context of the lifespan”. Dr. Enste’s research focuses on social and economic issues related to development trends in the health care industry. The research focuses on cross-sectional topics such as individual development trajectories, digitalization and social inequalities.

**Alexander Kucharski**\
\
Alexander Kucharski has been a research associate of the research focus Health Economy & Quality of Life (G&L) at the Institute of Work and Technology (IAT) since 2021. He studied social science at the Ruhr-Universität Bochum in both his Bachelor’s and Master’s degree programs (Health Systems and Health Economics). In his own research and in project work, he dealt with participatory design possibilities of digital health, assistance and care applications as well as their use by different target groups. In addition, his research focuses on the implementation conditions of digital care structures and the social implications of technical innovations in the healthcare sector.

Elena Cramer has been a research associate of the research focus Health Economy & Quality of Life (G&L) at the Institute for Work and Technology (IAT) since 2020. She studied physiotherapy at the Hochschule für Gesundheit Bochum. She then completed her Master of Science in Evidence-based Health Care with a focus on scientific work/research methods, health care delivery, data analysis and applied physiology in health care. In addition to her studies, she worked recurrently as a physical therapist in neurorehabilitation and orthopedics. From 2017 to 2020, Ms. Cramer worked as a research assistant in the interdisciplinary research project “RehaBoard”. Elena Cramer’s research focuses on digitalization in healthcare, care analyses and health literacy research.
