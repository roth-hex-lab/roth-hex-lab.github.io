VISKIMED3D (German: (Visuell-Sprachliche KI-Modelle für Inklusive Medizinische Anwendungen in 3D) is a two-year project funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy.

The project aims to develop a digital system that can capture human movements in detail and provide multimodal intelligent feedback in real time. The system will be available for use in the healthcare sector. In the field of digital physiotherapy, the system will be used on commercially available devices such as smartphones in private settings. The user is filmed while performing the exercises and the system provides immediate feedback. It assesses whether the exercises are being performed correctly or incorrectly and offers individual suggestions for improvement.
