DEREK (German: (Datengetriebene Entscheidungsunterstützung für die Roboter-assistierte Endoprothetik durch KI-basierte Digital Twins) is a three-year BMFTR funded project with a total volume of 1.47 Million Euros.

The overall goal of DEREK is the research and development to develop a decision support system that uses peri- and intraoperative data to enable patient-specific alignment of the implant, theragnostic patient care, and thus optimization of medical outcomes in knee arthroplasty. Compared to existing alignment techniques, which are based purely on imaging or intraoperative measurements and lead to unsatisfactory results, we are pursuing an innovative approach. Based on multi-source data, DEREK will generate an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven, personalized data model (patient twin) that, for the first time, allows the patient's own anatomy to be taken into account precisely in the alignment of the knee prosthesis.

Today we are very happy to internally kick off our new project KARVIMIO which is founded by the BMFTR. Our HEX Lab team will lead the project in collaboration with the medical experts from the LMU Klinikum, medtec specialists from Medability, and our colleagues from IAT who focus on participatory, ethical and security aspects.

Moticon focuses on developing digital solutions for recording and analyzing movement patterns in the lower extremities using sensor insoles. The focus is on generating and interpreting precise, objective movement and load data. The company's core product is the Moticon sensor sole and the associated software platform. The unique selling point of the wearables lies in the combination of highly accurate force, pressure distribution, and motion measurement using pressure sensors and IMU sensors in a fully integrated sensor sole without cables or switches.

**IAT**\
\
The Institute of Work and Technology (IAT) is a central scientific institution of the Westphalian University of Applied Sciences (WH) in cooperation with the Ruhr University Bochum. The focus “Health Economy & Quality of Life” combines research, development and testing of innovative design solutions in the health economy with the aim of creating a demand-oriented supply design, identifying and overcoming obstacles to innovation and demonstrating sustainable design options. In order to achieve these goals, the project is being conducted on several levels, from which three thematic areas can be derived: 1 Health care – health care on a national and international level in the outpatient and inpatient sectors; 2 Individual health – health development trajectories, health behavior, personal responsibility for health and health competence; 3 Living conditions – demographic change, products and services for the elderly, but also forms of living and forms of life-world-oriented (self-)organization.
\
The three thematic areas are not to be understood as separate research units; rather, there are a number of interfaces that are reflected in the activities of the research focus. These interfaces are demographic change digitalization, social inequality and economic efficiency. In the area of digital health and assistive technologies, the IAT can draw on a broad range of experience from projects dealing with ELSI issues in.

**Dr. Peter Enste**\
\
Dr. Peter Enste has been director of the research focus Health Economy & Quality of Life (G&L) at the Institute for Work and Technology (IAT) since 2020. He studied social sciences at the Ruhr University Bochum and completed his doctorate on the topic of “Health-related personal responsibility in the context of the lifespan”. Dr. Enste’s research focuses on social and economic issues related to development trends in the health care industry. The research focuses on cross-sectional topics such as individual development trajectories, digitalization and social inequalities.

Alexander Kucharski has been a research associate of the research focus Health Economy & Quality of Life (G&L) at the Institute of Work and Technology (IAT) since 2021. He studied social science at the Ruhr-Universität Bochum in both his Bachelor’s and Master’s degree programs (Health Systems and Health Economics). In his own research and in project work, he dealt with participatory design possibilities of digital health, assistance and care applications as well as their use by different target groups. In addition, his research focuses on the implementation conditions of digital care structures and the social implications of technical innovations in the healthcare sector.
