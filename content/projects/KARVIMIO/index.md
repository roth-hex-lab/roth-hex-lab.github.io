KARVIMIO (German: (KI-basierte Augmented Reality Visualisierung von Bedienungsanleitungen medizinischer Instrumente im Operationssaal) is a three-year BMBF funded project with a total volume of 1.73 Million Euros.

The overall goal of KARVIMIO is the research and development of an Artificial intelligence (AI) based Augmented Reality (AR) assistance system to support the operating room (OR) team in the hospital in order to increase process and treatment quality and patient safety. AI-based object recognition and tracking through static dynamic camera sensors will be used to automatically detect the medical instrument in focus and its condition. Through multimodal interaction with AR glasses, the medical staff will be able to quickly visualize the relevant operating instructions, in order to have the necessary information available at the point of use. This project aims to solve a common problem in the OR, that are difficulties in instrument handling. These typically require the gathering of necessary information in paper or PDF based manuals, an in turn a pause during the procedure that causes reduced patient care and safety. KARVIMIO therefore aligns with the goal of the WHO Global Patient Safety and Action Plan 2021-2030 to keep necessary instrument instructions always at spot.

{{< spoiler text="Co-Creation Workshop @ LMU 31.01.2023" >}}
To get the perspectives of the different stakeholders (such as surgeons, surgeon’s assistant, medtech industry and clinical IT) we discussed in two focus groups how intercation possibilities can and should look like and what technical and administrative framework conditions are. We thank the 22 participants from different disciplines very much for their valueable feedback and are excited to incorporate all this valuable information into the further development process!
