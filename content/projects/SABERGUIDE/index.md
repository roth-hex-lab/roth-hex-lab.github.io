SABERGUIDE is a joined project together with Angela Schoellig (TUM) and Stefan Leutenegger (ETH Zurich). 
Together, we explore drone based reconstruction of accident scenes. This project focuses on sensor-fusion, multi-sensor reconstruction and interaction with novel reconstruction methods in XR. 

The aim of our aerial XR teleguidance in emergency scenarios is to address accident rescue scenarios in an efficient and technical way.
