# Welcome!

Welcome to HEX Lab. Established in 2021 and relocated to the Technical University of Munich (TUM) in 2023, the Human-Centered Computing and Extended Reality Lab aims at pioneering new technologies for the enhancement of medical care and healthcare. We pursue fundamental, translational, and radical blue-sky research to improve medicine for patients and healthcare professionals.

We adopt a holistic perspectivce on machine intelligence emphasizing on AI-driven technologies that enable meaningful collaboration between humans and machines. Therefore, we operate at the intersections of the fields of human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, extended reality, robotics, and medicine.

Examplary research areas include AI-based assistance systems for surgical procedures, systems for the assessment and diagnosis of diseases and disorders, telepresence procedures and robot-assisted rehabilitation measures.

We perform our research integratively as part of TUM's School of Medicine and Health and the University Hospital Klinikum rechts der Isar, Department Clinical Medicine, with an affiliation to the Clinic for Orthopedics and Sports Orthopedics.
