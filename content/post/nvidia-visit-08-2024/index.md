On Friday, 07.08.2024, we had the pleasure to welcome Maximilian Ofir and Dr. Christine Eilers from NVIDIA. 
We got a live demonstration of the NVIDIA Clara AGX system. 

Moreover, Constantin showed again his great work from IPCAI 2024, and our visitors tried it out themselves.
Great achievement Constantin and Team! Let's see what great projects will follow on new hardware!
