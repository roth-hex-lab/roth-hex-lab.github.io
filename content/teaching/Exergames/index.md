In the course, students will be provided with theoretical game-design, gamification and medical foundations and work in small groups to realize working exergame prototypes. 
Exemplary project themes could be:

- Designing exergames for rehabilitation and physiotherapy
- Designing gamified approaches for performance optimization in sports
- VR supported simulations for patients with motor impairments

The course is designed in an interactive project format. Based on initial discussions and theoretical input, students research, design, develop, and evaluate solutions in the form of projects and studies in small groups following user-centered design and agile software engineering principles.
